It's been 5 months since I started at Learn.co and it was an amazing experience. It still is actually. I must admit the final project is the most challenging for me. Even though I solved all the labs on React-Redux, it turned out I still lacked comprehensive understanding of these technologies. Up until now I thought that back-end is my favorite part of programming, now it's backend AND React-Redux. Not sure why, probably because only now I start getting it :)

I wanted my project to be simple so I could finish it quickly and start job hunting. On the other hand I understand that it's going to be a major part of my portfolio. So I came up with a compromise: it will be a simple app that shows a user random quotes on Advaita Vedanta with a possibility to rate and add new quotes to the database. The bonus part is that it implements user authentication.
