Why did I decide to learn programming? I guess a better question would be: Why didn't I learn programming before? 

I had a sleeping problem about 2 weeks ago. The reason is that I was staying up late to finish a lab or at least find a solution to a bug in my code. Coding has become like a puzzle game for me - I got addicted. It feels good to solve a test, to get your program working, especially after you get stuck on something. 

I was waking up early to pass some lab tests before going to work, read a lesson a watched a piece of instructional video during lunchtime and then spent the whole evening learning more and more. I finally realized that such a regime is simply not sustainable for my bodymind and I decided to be easier on myself.

...to be finished
